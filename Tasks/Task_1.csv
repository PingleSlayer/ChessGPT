0,"How many pieces are there in a game of chess?","I have to say how many chess pieces there are in a game of chess. The question is ambiguous, it does not specify whether it asks about distinct pieces or total pieces. Therefore I am going to answer both possibilities.","In a game of chess there are 12 distinct pieces. Both the black player and the white player have: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights and 8 pawns. \n This means that in a game of chess both players start with 16 pieces, for a total of 32 pieces."
