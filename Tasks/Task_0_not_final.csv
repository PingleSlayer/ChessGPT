Is there anything chess related I can help you with?], [HENRI][Yes, I keep losing games because of stupid blunders. Do you have any tips for me?]","I have to give Henri tips on how to blunder less. At the level of 1453 ELO blunders are still quite common, but can usually be prevented by asking some useful questions about the move you are about to play before actually playing it.","Before making a move you should ask yourself a few questions. For example: \n If I make this move, does my opponent have any annoying checks? \n If I make this move, can my opponent capture any of my pieces? \n If I make this move, can my opponent attack any of my pieces? \n If I make this move, what is my opponent's response? \n When you ask yourself these questions everytime you make a move, you will find that you will make way less blunders."
